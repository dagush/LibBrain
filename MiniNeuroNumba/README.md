# Mini-NeuroNumba
This is a set of convenience modules to be used together with NeuroNumba (https://github.com/neich/neuronumba)

The idea is to have a simplified version of NeuroNumba amenable for non-Computer Scientists. At this moment, 
it simplifies the BOLD generation process, but more modules/functionalities will be added in the future 
as developed.
